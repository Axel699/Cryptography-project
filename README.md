# Cryptography-project

The objective of the project I created is an interactive Python program that allows the
user to:

– Encrypt/decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher.
– Input the message to be encrypted/decrypted.
– Specify the rotation used by the Caesar cipher.
– Extract statistics about the messages, such as letter frequency, maximum word length.
– Automate the identification of the rotation needed to decipher an encrypted message.

Part 1 - Encryption and Decryption 
Part 2 - Analysing Messages 
Part 3 - Messages from a File
Part 4 - Automated Decryption
